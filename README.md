ðŸ‘‹ Hi, thank you for visiting my GitHub repository. I am Daniel, a Data Scientist working in an IT company with collaborate with a bank.

## About me
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing machine-learning models to predict the upcoming cyberattack events. I used first- and second-order Markov chain, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and deep learning models. The best performing models yield 91% accuracy in predicting cyber threats of upcoming months.
