## Hi There!

ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository. 
I am Daniel, a data scientist working in an IT company and collaborating with a bank.

## About me
- ðŸ”­ Currently, Iâ€™m developing machine-learning models to predict the upcoming cyberattack events. I used first- and second-order Markov chain, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (Auto-ARIMA), and deep learning models. The best-performing models yield 91% accuracy in predicting cyber threats in upcoming months.
