## Hi there 

👋 Hi, I am Daniel. I am a Data Scientist.

## About me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing machine-learning models to predict the upcoming cyberattack events. I used first- and second-order Markov chain, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and deep learning models. The best performing models yield 91% accuracy in predicting cyber threats of upcoming months.
